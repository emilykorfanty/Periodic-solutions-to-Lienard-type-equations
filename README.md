Here you can find the source code that produces the figures in the open access paper 
*[Periodic solutions for a class of conservative Li√©nard-type equations](https://www.4open-sciences.org/articles/fopen/pdf/2019/01/fopen180047.pdf)*.

In the paper, we prove the existence of a non-trivial solution to the periodic boundary value problem
$$
x'' + f(t)x = g(x) \,, \quad x(0) = x(T)\,, x'(0) = x'(T) \,.
$$

Given a continuous function $f(t)$, we create visual interpretations of our conditions on $g(x)$ that guarantee the existence of a solution.
This is very helpful for applying the theorem: just make sure that the function $g(x)$ doesn't pass through any of the coloured regions!
